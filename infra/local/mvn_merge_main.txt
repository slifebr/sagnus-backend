Merge Feature to Main Plan
Goal
Merge code from feat/worker-asyncxml-retry-dlq to main.

User Review Required
Untracked Corp Files: There are untracked files in sagnus-bc-corp (e.g., TransportadoraController.java). Are these part of the worker feature?
If NO, I will only commit the sagnus-bc-nfe changes.
If YES, I will add them.
Tracked Binary Files: sagnus-shared-kernel/target/ has tracked class files. I recommend removing them from git (but keeping them on disk).
Proposed Changes
Cleanup: Execute git rm --cached -r on sagnus-shared-kernel/target and other binary paths if found.
Commit:
Add sagnus-bc-nfe changes.
Add sagnus-bc-corp changes (ONLY if confirmed).
Commit with message "feat: worker async xml retry dlq implementation".
Merge:
Checkout main.
Pull main.
Merge feat/worker-asyncxml-retry-dlq.
Push: Push main.
Verification Plan
Automated Tests
Run mvn clean install -DskipTests to verify build.
